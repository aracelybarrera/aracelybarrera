    <p>The arduino pong project was designed in order to help a ping pong ball go over a net with a program called arduino kit. I didn't create this project alone I had the help of a partner and many guides; the process was not easy because there was always something that would malfunction and had to be fixed or changed to something diffent. One example of a change was the tunnel that was added this is because the spoon wouldn't go far so my partner and I had to add a tunnel so the ball wouldn't get side tracked and go over the net. Another part of this project was making sure that turing the trials the ball would go over the net at least 5 times and this design did accomplish that goal. </p>
